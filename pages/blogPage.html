            <h> Black Orchestra has reached Top 5 on ModDB's "Mod of The Year"!</h>
            <h> Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, from the Black Orchestra Team </h>

            <p> We are grateful to be accepted into the 'ModDB's Mod of The Year' Top Five. This gesture has proven that
                our little project has a place in people's hearts; people believe in our efforts and our visions and
                want us to be successful. As 2023 is closing, we would like to walk you down the memory lane and address
                how our project come about.</p>
            <p> Our mod started out as two separate identities: Desert Rats and Red Orchestra Remake. Desert Rat's
                ambitious goal was to introduce the Second World War North Africa and Mediterranean front to Rising
                Storm 2. Red Orchestra remake aims to not only port Red Orchestra 2, Rising Storm 1, and Heroes of The
                West but to completely overhaul it with modern quality-of-life features. After the launch of Talvisota:
                Winter War, the need for a World War Two game in the Rising Storm 2 formula has been recognized. </p>
            <p> Since there is a great overlapping of talents from both teams, and both were working on very similar
                visions, we have found that a merge was beneficial to the development of both. In fact, we have known
                each other for a long time, for most of us have worked on Talvisota: Winter War, another total
                conversion for Rising Storm 2. As people said, divided we fall, together we win; it was fated that we
                would combine our efforts. </p>
            <p> Desert Rats' (or DR) core strength was it maps. Their dedicated mapper created wonderful levels that is
                not only eye-catchy, but also is aim to deliver good performance and gameplay. RO Remake (Or RR)
                excelled in quality-of-life changes, as it was created on the Gameplay Overhaul Mutator (GOM) framework,
                and is also championed with a dedicated animator and modeller that breathes life into the game. We take
                what's best of both worlds and combine it to one project that we all know as Black Orchestra.
            <p> As a final note, it would not have been possible without the hard-working contributors and the loyal
                followers who believed in us. </p>
            <p> That's our little fireplace story to you. Take care and enjoy the Holidays. - Hoover </p>

            <h> Please welcome our Black Orchestra Map Update! </h>

            <p> All maps set in the Mediterranean theatre of war including several Eastern, Western and Pacific front
                maps are produced by Level Artist/Level Designer North_Dumpling with additional asset assistance from
                FaNgum. </p>

            <p> While our maps are based on historical battles they take place in, it is not always a smart decision to
                portray locations in their 1:1 scale as gameplay always comes first for us, so certain liberties are
                made. </p>

            <p> Each and every map always requires thoughtful design process starting with blockout and finishing with
                visual polishing. </p>

            <p> Our maps are always made based on specific metrics we have set ourselves such as visuals, geomorphology,
                location, factions involved and weapons/vehicles used by the teams. </p>


            <p> Everything you see currently is WIP and subject to change. </p>

            <h> Welcome to the official Black Orchestra: World Front website </h>
            <p> I created this website so that we could have an embed for our ModDB competition as a gag. But then I
                realized, if I come to this length,
                spent actual money on a domain and time sorting all of this out, why shouldn't I do something
                greater? </p>
            <p> Anyway, all of us at the Black Orchestra development team have thought that this was a fun idea, and
                also an opportunity to be more serious in our development.
                We'll see what we can do with this website in the future. Maybe... this place will benefit as a
                development blog. </p>

            <p> As a starter, here's the German M40 field coat I made a while ago. Well... I guess that's all I'm
                willing to share. I'm not a blogger. - Hoover </p>
