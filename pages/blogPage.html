            <h> Please welcome our Black Orchestra Map Update! </h>

            <p> All maps set in the Mediterranean theatre of war including several Eastern, Western and Pacific front
                maps are produced by Level Artist/Level Designer North_Dumpling with additional asset assistance from
                FaNgum. </p>

            <p> While our maps are based on historical battles they take place in, it is not always a smart decision to
                portray locations in their 1:1 scale as gameplay always comes first for us, so certain liberties are
                made. </p>

            <p> Each and every map always requires thoughtful design process starting with blockout and finishing with
                visual polishing. </p>

            <p> Our maps are always made based on specific metrics we have set ourselves such as visuals, geomorphology,
                location, factions involved and weapons/vehicles used by the teams. </p>


            <p> Everything you see currently is WIP and subject to change. </p>

            <h> To see full update please check ModDB. </h>

            <h> Welcome to the official Black Orchestra: World Front website </h>
            <p> I created this website so that we could have an embed for our ModDB competition as a gag. But then I
                realized, if I come to this length,
                spent actual money on a domain and time sorting all of this out, why shouldn't I do something
                greater? </p>
            <p> Anyway, all of us at the Black Orchestra development team have thought that this was a fun idea, and
                also an opportunity to be more serious in our development.
                We'll see what we can do with this website in the future. Maybe... this place will benefit as a
                development blog. </p>

            <p> As a starter, here's the German M40 field coat I made a while ago. Well... I guess that's all I'm
                willing to share. I'm not a blogger. - Hoover </p>
